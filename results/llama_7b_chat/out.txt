The heat from the coffee is transferred to the cup through a process called thermal conduction, where the molecules of the hot liquid move slowly and transfer their energy to the molecules of the cup. This process occurs through direct contact between the liquid and the cup, and it's what allows the coffee to stay warm for a long time without burning your hands. Additionally, the cup is usually made of a material that can absorb and distribute heat evenly, such as ceramic or glass, which helps to keep the coffee at a consistent temperature.
