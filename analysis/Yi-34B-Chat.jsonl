The CNS processes information and coordinates movement, while the PNS transmits signals between the CNS and the muscles, skin, and internal organs. When a stimulus is received, such as a touch or a sound, specialized receptors in the body convert that stimulus into electrical signals. These signals are then transmitted through the PNS to the CNS, where they are processed by the brain and spinal cord. The CNS generates a response, which is then relayed back through the PNS to the muscles and organs, causing them to react accordingly.

This allows Bosons to occupy the same quantum state, leading to phenomena like laser cooling and Bose-Einstein condensates. On the other hand, particles with half-integer spin (such as electrons) are Fermions because their wavefunctions are antisymmetric under exchange, which means that the particle changes sign when its position is swapped with another identical particle.

The initial expansion was driven by the desire for furs and the search for a Northeast Passage to Asia. Russian explorers, such as Yermak Timofeyevich, led expeditions that defeated the indigenous tribes and established Russian control over the region. The conquest of Siberia was gradual and took several decades, with the final subjugation of the nomadic peoples in the 17th and 18th centuries. The expansion was facilitated by the use of local allies, the Cossacks, and the establishment of forts along key rivers. The acquisition of Siberia provided the Russian Empire with vast natural resources, including fur, gold, and later, oil, as well as a land bridge to the Pacific Ocean.", "category": "hard_fact"}

The hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis is also activated, leading to the release of stress hormones such as cortisol and adrenaline, which further enhance the body's ability to respond to the perceived threat.
